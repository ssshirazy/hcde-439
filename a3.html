    <h4>1: In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does
        it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.</h4>
    <img src="images/q1-a3.jpeg"/>
    <h4>2: Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage.
        Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</h4>

    <p>When I wasn't flashing my phone at the photoresistor, the value read about 443.
        When I turned it on, they read 880. The graph is for turing my flash on and off year for a second.
    </p>
    <h4>3: AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values.
        Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. 
        How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</h4>
    <p>The range for AnalogWrite for a 10-bit PWM is 0-1023 instead of 0-255. For a 16-bit analog-to-digital
        converter, the output values would range from 0-65,536. As a result, the change this would
        have on the map() would effect its input values. Similarly to how I mapped the min/max measured in my
        code, I would imagine that something similar could be done with the new bit values: map(val,
        0, 65535, 0, 1023). This maps the input values from the analog-to-digital converter to the output range
        for the 10-bit PWM.

    <h4>Calculations</h4>
    <img src="images/a3-calc.jpeg">
    <p>Calculations for calculating the resistors needed for the LEDs and the photoresistor. For the red and green,
        I calculated 160 Ohms, in order to use a single resistor, I decided to use the one that was the
        closest number to this value (and was higher than 160), which was the 220 Ohm resister. For a similar
        reason, I decided on using the 100 Ohm resistor for the blue led--although the calculated value
        was 85 Ohms. For the photoresistor, to keep the current within a safe zone of 0.5 mA, the resistance needed to be 
        10,000 Ohms.</p>

    <h4>My Code</h4>
    <pre><code>
        // constant numbers (will not change)
        const int green = 13; // the number of the green LED pin
        const int blue = 10; // the number of the blue LED pin
        const int red = 11; // the number of the red LED pin
        
        int sensorMin = 1023; // minimum sensor value
        int sensorMax = 0; // maximum sensor value
        
        int x = A0; // pin number assoicated with the photoresistor   
        int sensVal = 0; // value read by photoresistor
        
        void setup() { // initializes the LED pins for output, runs once when board is powered/reset
          Serial.begin(9600); // allows the values read by the sensor to be printed in the serial monitor
          pinMode(green, OUTPUT); // initializes pin 13 as an output for a green LED
          pinMode(blue, OUTPUT); // initializes pin 10 as an output for a blue LED
          pinMode(red, OUTPUT); // initializes pin 11 as an output for a red LED
        
          while (millis() < 7000) { // calibration will occur during the first 7 seconds
            sensVal = analogRead(x); // the value read from the photoresistor
            Serial.println("Calibration period. The value being read is: " + String(sensVal) + "."); // prints the reading to the serial monitor
        
            if (sensVal > sensorMax) { // updates if a new maximum value is read
              sensorMax = sensVal; // sets the max equal to the new value read
            }
        
            if (sensVal < sensorMin) { // updates if a new minimum value is read
              sensorMin = sensVal; // sets the min equal to the new value read
            }
          
          
          digitalWrite(green, HIGH); // powers green LED, voltage is set to HIGH (5V). A visual indicator that informs the user when calibration is done
          delay(500); // delays for half of a second 
          digitalWrite(green, LOW); // turns off green LED, voltage set to LOW (0V)
          }
        }
        
        void loop() { // code repeated until power is no longer supplied or board is reset
          digitalWrite(green, HIGH); // powers green LED, voltage is set to HIGH (5V)
          digitalWrite(red, HIGH); // powers red LED, voltage is set to HIGH (5V)
        
          sensVal = analogRead(x); // the value read from the photoresistor
          sensVal = constrain(sensVal, sensorMin, sensorMax); // constrains the sensor reading to be between the minimum and maximum values read from calibration
        
          sensVal = map(sensVal, sensorMin, sensorMax, 0, 255); // maps the minimum sensor value read from calibration to 0 and the maximum value read to 255
        
          analogWrite(blue, sensVal); // set the brightness of blue LED based on the sensor value (sensVal)
        }

    <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
    For my code, I used the Arduino calibration example to help me set up my calibration. I referenced lesson slides A1-A5
    to help with creating my schematics and answering the questions.
