    <h4>My answers to the questions</h4>
    <img src="images/A2-answers.jpeg" /> 
    <p>For question 1, I graphed each cycle for an input of 255, 128 and 64. 255 refers to a 
      full cycle, which means the LED would be on the whole time. 128 is about half of that,
      meaning it would be on for 50%. Finally, 64 is about a fourth of 255, meaning it would be on
      for approx that amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>For question 2, I first started with calculating the total current from all 4 of my LEDs.
      Then, I divided the total power from the battery by the total current I calculated to find
      the number of hours that could be supplied from it.

    <h4>Calculations</h4>   
    <img src="images/A2-calc.jpeg" />
    <p>Calculations for calculating the resistors needed for the LEDs and button. For the red, yellow and green,
      I calculated 160 Ohms, in order to use a single resistor, I decided to use the one that was the
      closest number to this value (and was higher than 160), which was the 220 Ohm resister. For a similar
      reason, I decided on using the 100 Ohm resistor for the blue led--although the calculated value
      was 85 Ohms. For the button, to keep the current within a safe zone of 0.5 mA, the resistance needed to be 
      10,000 Ohms.</p>

          if (buttonState == HIGH) {  // checks if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
            digitalWrite(greenLED, HIGH); // powers LED connected to pin 13 (green LED), voltage is set to HIGH (5V)

            analogWrite(yellowLED, brightness); // set the brightness of yellow LED
            brightness = brightness + fadeAmount; // change the brightness for next time through the loop, brightness increases 
            if (brightness <= 0 || brightness >= 255) { // reverse the fading direction when reaching the minimum (0) or maximum (255) brightness
              fadeAmount = - fadeAmount; // reverses the fade (either dim or brighten)
            }
            delay(30); // delays for 30 milliseconds, for the fade effect
        
          } else { // if the button is not pressed
            digitalWrite(greenLED, LOW); // turns off LED connected to pin 13 (green LED), voltage is set to LOW (0V)
