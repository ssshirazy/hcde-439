    <p>Calculations for calculating the resistors needed for the LEDs and button. For the red, yellow and green,
      I calculated 160 Ohms, in order to use a single resistor, I decided to use the one that was the
      closest number to this value (and was higher than 160), which was the 220 Ohm resister. For a similar
      reason, I decided on using the 100 Ohm resistor for the blue led--although the calculated value
      was 85 Ohms. For the button, to keep the current within a safe zone of 0.5 mA, the resistance needed to be 
      10,000 Ohms.</p>
