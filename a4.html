    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    <img src="images/a4-q1.jpeg"/>
    <p>Graph of question 1. The width of the bars get wider because the servo is going up in angle
        based on the "i" in the for loop.
    </p>
    <h4>2: Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time.
        How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h4>
    <img src="images/a4-q2.jpg"/>
    <p>To address this erroneous reading, I would first start by establishing proper minimum and maximum bounds during calibration. 
        Then, during the reading phase, I would make sure that the values being measured are within the minimum and maximum that I calibrated.
        If it falls outside of that (less than the minimum or greater than the maximum), I would print out a message to let the user know that
        the value read was erroneous.
    </p>
    <h4>3: Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%.
        How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h4>
    <img src="images/a4-q3.jpeg"/>
    <p> To adjust the measurement based on a 10% deviation, first, I would compare the reading to the expected value.
        If the measurement is higher than expected, I would reduce it by 10% (multiply by 0.9).
        If it's lower than expected, I would increase it by 10% (multiply by 1.1).
        If the measurement is exactly equal to the expected value, no change is made.
        This makes sure that the measurement is adjusted depending on whether it is above or below the expected value.
    </p>
    <h4>Resistor Justification</h4>
    <p>I used a 1M Ohm Resistor. This is because the capacitor is measuring human resistance,
        which can range between 10,000-1,000,000, depending on different factors.
        I chose 1M Ohm specifically because it falls within the range of resistance the human body typically has, 
        creating a reference to measure the change in capacitance when someone touches the sensor.

    <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
    For my code, I used the Arduino calibration example to help me set up my calibration. I referenced lesson slides A6
    to help with creating my schematic and the capacitor code. To help fix the library <> characters to show up, I utilized ChatGPT to add the HTML code
    for the ">" "<" signs.
