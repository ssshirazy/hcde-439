    <h1>Samira's Assignment 1!</h1>

      <p>Here is all the documentation for assignment 1!
        1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.

        2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?
        Since there are 14 digital PWMs, I believe that the Arduino board could hold 14 total
        light bulbs. Thus, I could make 14 light bulbs blink independently.
        
        3: How many LEDs could you blink with your Arduino if only one were to be on at once? (this question is not required!)

        4: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
        Around 15-20 millisecond delay (for both HIGH and LOW) was when the LED looked more like it was flickering. I was 
        not able to tell that it was turning on and off.
