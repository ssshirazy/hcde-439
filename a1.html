    <h4>1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs.
      Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</h4>
      <img src="images/graph.jpeg" />
      <p>Graph that shows the voltage across 4 seconds for each of my 4 LEDs (red, blue, yellow and green).</p>
    <h4>2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</h4>
    <p>
      Since there are 14 digital PWMs, I believe that the Arduino board could hold 14 total
      LEDs. Thus, I could make 14 LEDs blink independently. Since each LED has
      0.02 amps, 14 x 0.02 amps will mean a total current of 0.28 amps.
    </p>
    <h4>4: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</h4>
    <p>
      Around 15-20 millisecond delay (for both HIGH and LOW) was when the LED looked more like it was flickering. I was 
      not able to tell that it was turning on and off.

    <h4>Schematic</h4>

    <p>A schematic drawing of my circuit</p>
    <h4>Calculations</h4> 
    <img src="images/calculations.jpeg"/>
    <p>Calculations for calculating the resistors needed for the LEDs. For the red, yellow and green,
      I calculated 185 Ohms, in order to use a single resistor, I decided to use the one that was the
      closest number to this value (and was higher than 185), which was the 220 Ohm resister. For a similar
      reason, I decided on using the 100 Ohm resistor for the blue led--although the calculated value
      was 85 Ohms.

    <h4>My Code</h4>
    <pre><code>
      void setup() { // initializes the pins for output, runs once when board is powered/reset
          pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // initializes pin 13 as an output for a red LED
          pinMode(12, OUTPUT); // initializes pin 12 as an output for a blue LED
          pinMode(11, OUTPUT); // initializes pin 11 as an output for a yellow LED
          pinMode(10, OUTPUT); // initializes pin 10 as an output for a green LED
      }
      
      void loop() { // code repeated until power is no longer supplied or board is reset
          digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // powers LED connected to pin 13 (red LED), voltage is set to HIGH (5V)
          delay(250); // program is delayed for 250 milliseconds    
          digitalWrite(13, LOW); // turns off LED connected to pin 13 (red LED), voltage is set to LOW (0V)
          delay(250); // program is delayed for 250 milliseconds
          digitalWrite(12, HIGH); // powers LED connected to pin 12 (blue LED), voltage is set to HIGH (5V)
          delay(250); // program is delayed for 250 milliseconds
          digitalWrite(12, LOW); // turns off LED connected to pin 12 (blue LED), voltage is set to LOW (0V)
          delay(250); // program is delayed for 250 milliseconds
          digitalWrite(11, HIGH); // powers LED connected to pin 11 (yellow LED), voltage is set to HIGH (5V)
          delay(250); // program is delayed for 250 milliseconds
          digitalWrite(11, LOW); // turns off LED connected to pin 11 (yellow LED), voltage is set to LOW (0V)
          delay(250); // program is delayed for 250 milliseconds
          digitalWrite(10, HIGH); // powers LED connected to pin 10 (green LED), voltage is set to HIGH (5V)
          delay(250); // program is delayed for 250 milliseconds
          digitalWrite(10, LOW); // turns off LED connected to pin 10 (green LED), voltage is set to LOW (0V)
          delay(250); // program is delayed for 250 milliseconds  
      }
