    <h4>1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs.
      Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</h4>

    <h4>2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</h4>
    <p>
      Since there are 14 digital PWMs, I believe that the Arduino board could hold 14 total
      light bulbs. Thus, I could make 14 light bulbs blink independently. Since each LED has
      0.02 amps, 14 x 0.02 amps will mean a total current of 0.28 amps.
    </p>
    <h4>4: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</h4>
    <p>
      Around 15-20 millisecond delay (for both HIGH and LOW) was when the LED looked more like it was flickering. I was 
      not able to tell that it was turning on and off.
